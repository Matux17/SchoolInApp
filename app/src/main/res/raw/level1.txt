Animals vegetarians
Animals are a part of our world. When people hear the word “animal” they think about beasts which eat
other animals. But we should not forget the “vegetarian” animals. A lot of people do research about their
life. One of the most interesting wild animal is lemur. There are 25 species of lemurs in Madagascar and
most of them are endangered. All lemurs are vegetarians. They eat wild figs, bananas and other forest
fruits. Another very interesting animal is African elephant. This beast is the biggest animal on Earth.
Elephants use their trunks to pluck at leaves and their tusks to tear branches. The African forest is also
home for chimpanzees and baboons. Groups of chimpanzees travel together looking for fruit and leaves to
eat.
