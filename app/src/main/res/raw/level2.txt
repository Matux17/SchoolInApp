Turkish food culture
The forms of nutrition are shaped by the cultural-geographical-ecological-economic structure and historical
processes. Turkish cuisine is called yiyecek-i√ßecek for the nutrition of people living in Turkey, their preparation,
cooking, preservation. All the practices and beliefs developed in the kitchen and eating with the tools and
techniques necessary for these processors should be understood. The richness of the Turkish cuisine is very
influential. In short, the variety in the products offered by the Central Asian and Anatolian lands played a role in
obtaining the new structure of our culinary culture, the new tastes that developed in the palaces of empires, such
as Seljuk and Ottoman, interacting with many different cultures over a long historical process. Soups consist of
olive oil and pasta dishes and meals prepared with random herbs. Turkish cuisine mostly contains molasses,
yogurt, bulgur and so on, as well as unique types of healthy food. There is a distinct sense of sanctity in the
forms of eating and drinking for the special occasions, celebrations and ceremonies. The Turkish Cuisine has a
variety of foods and beverages that are suitable for tastes, and can provide a healthy and balanced nutrition and
can be a source of vegetable cuisine. The most famous Turkish food is Kebab which is made of meat, yogurt and
pide- special bread of Turkey.
